# Sensors  

### Brief  
  
Sensors for hydroponic/aeroponic systems help measure metrics required for healthy plant growth.  
Few of the metrics measured for CEA are:  
  + Nutrient Solution
    - Electrical Conductivity (EC)
    - pH
    - TDS
  + Reservoir
    - Water level
    - Dissolved Oxygen
    - Temperature
  + Plumbing
    - Water flow rate
  + Misc
    - CO<sub>2</sub>   
    - Relative humidity  
    - Energy sensor/meter  
    - Quantum light sensor  
    - PID controller  
    - Ambient temperature

Of these metrics for which sensors are required, few require rigorous maintenance  
and cleaning routine.  

Meaning calibration and storage of these sensors must be performed with utmost care  
so as not to lose longevity or cause erroneous measurements.
