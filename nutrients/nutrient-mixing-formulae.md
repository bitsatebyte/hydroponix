# Nutrient Mixing Guide

## Introduction

Hydroponic fertilizer recipes are always provided in ppm. The first thing that needs to be done is to convert ppm to mg/l
    1 ppm = 1mg/l (1 part per million equals 1 milligram per liter)
    For example, if a recipe calls for 150 ppm Nitrogen, what we want is 150 mg/l or 150 milligrams of Nitrogen in 1 liter of irrigation water.

Nutrient solution recipes also use ppm P (phosphorous) and ppm K (potassium). This is different than fertilizer recommendations for vegetable and fruit production in the field, which use P2O5 (phosphate) and K2O (potash). Fertilizer grades also are expressed as phosphate and potash.

Phosphate and Potash include Oxygen and we need to account for that in hydroponic calculations.

P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> contains 43% P and K2O contains 83% K.

    #### Givens

        - 1 ppm = 1 mg/l
        - P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> = 43% P
        - K2O = 83% K

How do we determine how much 20-10-20 fertilizer is needed to supply 150 ppm N with a 20-Liter stock tank and a fertilizer injector set to a 100:1 concentration?

## Nutrient mixing method
    
    - Start by writing down the concentration you want to end up with. In this case, 150 ppm of N
    or 150 mg/l

        *(150 milligrams N)/1 liter water*

    - Now begin to convert this into what you want to end up with. In this case, grams of fertilizer to add to a
    20-Liter tank using a 100:1 injector concentration.
