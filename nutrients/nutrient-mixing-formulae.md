# Nutrient Mixing Guide

## Introduction

Hydroponic fertilizer recipes are always provided in ppm. The first thing that needs to be done is to convert ppm to mg/l.  
1 ppm = 1mg/l (1 part per million equals 1 milligram per liter)  
For example, if a recipe calls for 150 ppm Nitrogen, what we want is 150 mg/l or 150 milligrams of Nitrogen in 1 liter of irrigation water.  

Nutrient solution recipes also use ppm P (phosphorous) and ppm K (potassium). This is different than fertilizer  
recommendations for vegetable and fruit production in the field, which use P2O5 (phosphate) and K2O (potash).  
Fertilizer grades also are expressed as phosphate and potash.

Phosphate and Potash include Oxygen and we need to account for that in hydroponic calculations.

P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> contains 43% P and K<sub>2</sub>O contains 83% K.

#### Givens

   - 1 ppm = 1 mg/l
   - P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> = 43% P
   - K<sub>2</sub>O = 83% K

How do we determine how much 20-10-20 fertilizer is needed to supply 150 ppm N with a 20-Liter stock tank and a fertilizer  
injector set to a 100:1 concentration?

## Nutrient mixing method
    
   - Start by writing down the concentration you want to end up with. In this case, 150 ppm of N
   or 150 mg/l

   _(150 milligrams N)/1 liter water_

   - Now begin to convert this into what you want to end up with. In this case, grams of fertilizer to add to a
   20-Liter tank using a 100:1 injector concentration.
   
   **(150 mg N)/(1 L water) * (1 g N)/(1000 mg N)**
   - This gets us the result in **g Nitrogen/L**  
   - Continue this process and convert grams of Nitrogen to grams of fertilizer.
   - Since our fertilizer is a 20-10-20, it means that it has 20% Nitrogen. In other words, 100 grams of  
   fertilizer contains 20 grams of Nitrogen.

   _(150 milligrams N)/(1 L water) * (1 g N)/(1000 mg N) * (100 g Fertilizer)/(20 g N)_

   - Multiply this by the amount of water (in Liters) in our stock tank.
   
   ***(150 mg N)/(1 L water) * (1 g N)/(1000 mg N) * (100 g Fertilizer)/(20 g N) * (20 L)***  
   **This is the first basic equation**

   - We just determined that we need to add **X** grams of fertilizer to supply **Y** ppm of Nitrogen using a 100:1  
   concentration. The fertilizer we used was 20-10-20.

   - So, in addition to the Nitrogen, we are also adding Phosphorous and Potassium.
   - The next equation will determine how much Phosphorous and Potassium we are adding.
   - Start off with the amount of fertilizer we are adding to our stock tank. The final units we  
   want are ppm or mg/l. As with the previous calculation, we will use our givens until we end up with these  
   units.
   - This is basically the first calculation in reverse.
