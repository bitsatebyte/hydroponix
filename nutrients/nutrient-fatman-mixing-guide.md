# Nutrient Mixing Guide (Adapted from Fatman)

This is a guide for mixing basically any nutrient formula, although there are some specific examples given for Lucas Formula, which is 5-10-9 **(N-P-K)**.

The basis for mixing your own nutrient formulation is rather easy. All nutrient formulas essentially have the same micro/trace nutrients. These are :  

- Manganese
- Boron
- Zinc
- Copper
- Molybdate
- Sulphur

In addition to these above trace nutrients, which are found in very small amounts, we have the meat and potatoes of nutrient formulas, which is **NPK-Ca-Mg**  

- Nitrogen
- Phosphorus
- Potassium
- Calcium
- Magnesium

Using the following chart, we can construct any nutrient formula using base ingredients.

For example, doing a **"Lucas"** formula, which by the way isn't considered that great of a formula for Cannabis growers,  
rather a formula that "works," **NPK** = 5-10-9  
N=5, P=10, K=9 and M=3  
i.e the Lucas Formula  

Amounts are in ***Grams*** : Final *ppm* each nutrient: N=176, P=133, K=300, M=100, Calcium=166  
> Part A.  
>  - Calcium Nitrate 2134.719
>  - Iron Chelate 63.78643

> Part B.  
>  - Mono Potassium Phosphate 2971.03
>  - Magnesium Sulfate 1910.758

> Trace Part B.
>  - Manganese Sulfate 12.700586
>  - Boric Acid 2.4097095
>  - Zinc Sulfate 0.25514571
>  - Copper Sulfate 0.085048569
>  - Ammonium Molybdate 0.0396893324


This recipe is for a x100 concentrate. That means a combination of 9.46353 Liters of Part A. And 9.46353 Liters of Part B to which the trace nutrients are added.  
With all mixed together in a dry mix you have the dry mix equivalent of Flora Nova Bloom without the added humus.


## Reasons for mixing?

There are already hundreds of other manufacturers producing nutrients at much cheaper costs than those sold by AN or GH.

I am saying that given the true analysis of any fertilizer product, the same nutrient of the same quality can be mixed in your home.  

All you need to formulate any known fertilzer is the guaranteed analysis. You will notice though that there are no AN analysis on the Washington State site.  

For a PK booster simply buy Monopotassium phosphate. It is used in about 95% of all the competitor two or three part formulas.  
Mono-Potassium Phosphate  
MKP
